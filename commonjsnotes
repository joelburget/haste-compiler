To install:

* `cabal install`
* `haste-boot --dev`

Unfortunately there's an error in `GHC.IO` which I haven't solved yet.
Workaround:

* `cd libraries/base-ghc-7.8/GHC/`
* remove `{- SOURCE -}` from line 50
* `haste-streaming < IO.hs > IO.js`
* `mv IO.js ~/.haste/haste-0.5.0_ghc-7.8.4/commonjs/base/GHC/`
* `cd -`

Another problem: A duplicated assignment in `base/GHC/Base.js`, line 254. Just
remove the errant assignment.
